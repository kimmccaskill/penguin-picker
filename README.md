# Penguin Picker

## A project by Kim McCaskill during Module 1 at Turing School of Software & Design.

### Learning Goals:
  * Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
    * semantic HTML
    * DRY JavaScript
    * localStorage to persist data
  * Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
  * Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
  * Match/recreate a UI and create a great UX

### Overview of Site:
  * Penguin Picker is a two-player game that replicates Concentration.
  * Each player takes turn flipping over two cards at a time.
  * If they match, that player “scores”.
  * If the two cards don’t match, they must be flipped back over.
  * The goal is the get the greatest amount of matches.
